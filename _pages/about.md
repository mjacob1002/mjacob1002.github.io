<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hey there! I'm Mat, a 4th year undergraduate at UIUC studying CS. I've done research in High Performance Computing, specifically with Charm++ and asyncrhonous task-based systems, as well as dabbling into the world of machine learning. My goal is to try and combine both the speed up techniques in high performance computing to the world of machine learning.

I've been fortunate to work with outstanding mentors and supervisors. At UIUC, I've been working with amazing Professor Laxmikant Kale in the Parallel Programming Lab, where I have worked on systems like CkIO. I have recently been trying to create new performant abstractions in Charm++ to
improve ease-of-building and performance of workloads like data processing. 

I have also been extremely in that I've worked with Databricks Mosaic Research as a Research Scientist Intern. Under the outstanding mentorship of Andrew Drozdov, Omar Khattab, Michael Carbin, Matei Zaharia, and Erik Lindgren, I focused on how to best improve RAG pipelines. I specifically focused on reranker models, and discovered new trends in the modern landscape that challenge the existing conventional knowledge in information retrieval.
