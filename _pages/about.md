<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey there, I'm Mat! I am a recent graduate of UIUC CS, and am an incoming PhD stuudent at the University of Washington for Fall 2025. Broadly speaking, I am interested in AI systems and better understanding the different tradeoffs that can be made, such as cost-quality and latency-quality. I am also interested in methods for improving their efficiency + scalability, as well as shifting the pareto frontier. 

At UIUC, I worked with the amazing [Professor Laxmikant Kale](https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/~kale/) in the [Parallel Programming Lab](http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/), where I have worked on high-performance computing systems and frameworks, specifically for Charm++. I helped build out CkIO, an I/O framework for HPC applicatoins at scale, as well as streaming systems to help adapt HPC frameworks to data processing workloads. 

In industry, I am  fortunate to have worked with Databricks Mosaic Research as a Research Scientist Intern. Under the outstanding mentorship of [Andrew Drozdov](https://mrdrozdov.github.io/), [Omar Khattab](https://omarkhattab.com/), [Michael Carbin](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/), [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/), and [Erik Lindgren](https://erikml.com/), I focused on how to best improve RAG pipelines. I specifically focused on reranker models, and discovered new trends in the modern landscape that challenge the existing conventional knowledge in information retrieval.
