<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hey there! I'm Mat, a 4th year undergraduate at UIUC studying CS. I've done research in High Performance Computing, specifically with [Charm++](https://github.com/charmplusplus/charm) and asynchronous task-based systems, as well as dabbling into the world of machine learning and information retrieval. My interests, broadly, include both systems and machine learning; specifically, I'm interested in both building high performance systems to support machine learning, as well as develop a better understanding of how machine learning models and paradigms behave in the real world through comprehensive empirical experiments. I am also interested in programming models for AI Systems and how we can make it easier to express these systems to increase robustness and accuracy. 

At UIUC, I've been working with amazing [Professor Laxmikant Kale](https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/~kale/) in the [Parallel Programming Lab](http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/), where I have worked on systems like CkIO. I have also been extremely fortunate in that I've worked with Databricks Mosaic Research as a Research Scientist Intern. Under the outstanding mentorship of [Andrew Drozdov](https://mrdrozdov.github.io/), [Omar Khattab](https://omarkhattab.com/), [Michael Carbin](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/), [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/), and [Erik Lindgren](https://erikml.com/), I focused on how to best improve RAG pipelines. I specifically focused on reranker models, and discovered new trends in the modern landscape that challenge the existing conventional knowledge in information retrieval.

In Fall 2025, I will be starting my PhD at the University of Washington, advised by [Stephanie Wang](https://stephanie-wang.github.io/) and [Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
