Happy to share that our work on scaling reranker inference in RAG pipelines will be presented at [ReNeuIR'25](https://reneuir.org/) at [SIGIR 2025](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/) in Padova, Italy! Huge thanks to the reviewers, my collaborators, and Databricks! You can see the updated paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11767).
