My preprint with the Parallel Programming Laboratory at UIUC, ["CkIO: Parallel File Input for Over-Decomposed Task-Based Systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18593) is on the arxiv! If you are using Chrome, make sure to download the preprint and view it on local viewer - some figures come out weird on Google Chrome it seems.
