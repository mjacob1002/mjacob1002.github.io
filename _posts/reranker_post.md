It's been about a week and a half since my preprint from Databricks Mosaic Research went live. If you want to see it, check out the [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11767) or the Twitter thread I posted. 
In this post, I wanted to detail the chronological story of how this work came to be, as well as some thoughts from someone who, before this, had done no ML research at all.
